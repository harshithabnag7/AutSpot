                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 
                communication, social interaction, and behavior, it affects 1 in 68 children. 
                Individuals with autism may struggle to understand and interpret social cues, 
                leading to difficulty in forming and maintaining relationships. 
                They may also have repetitive behaviors or interests, as well as sensory processing differences.
                 While there is no known cure for autism, ASD costs a family around 2 million $ on an average. 
                 Early intervention with therapies can help individuals with ASD learn and develop skills to navigate daily life more effectively.
